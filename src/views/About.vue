    <h1>Bug Report</h1>
    <p>
      Bug Report allows a end-user of your software to create an account, login, create a bug report or feature request,
      and then submit it to you with a screenshot and relevant URL.
    </p>

    <h2>User Story</h2>
    As a user, I want to be able to submit bug reports or feature requests easily and quickly.

    <h2>Road Map</h2>
    <p>
      This MVC/CRUD application makes it easier for end-users to make actionable bug reports. The relevant URL will be
      easily incorporated and the user can easily incorporate a screenshot of the issue.
    </p>
